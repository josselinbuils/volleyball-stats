# CLAUDE.md

Automatic per-player volleyball stats from one fixed sideline camera (see README.md): Python
pipeline in `src/volleyball_stats/`, match page in `web/` (React + shadcn/ui), one benchmark per
step in `benchmarks/`. The owner plays at ASPOM Bègles (adult leisure). Their camera: DJI Osmo
Action 3, 4K 50 fps; their processing PC: RTX 5080 under WSL2.

## Rules

- Speak English with the owner; the page and the review page open in French (fr first, then en, in
  `web/src/locales/`). UX first: understandable by anyone, never traded for performance.
- Never publish, host or share anything without the owner. The footage shows minors: anything
  hosted stays behind a password, anything shared outside has the footage blurred. Never republish
  the YouTube clips in `data/`.
- Commit with the personal identity (`Josselin BUILS <josselin.buils@gmail.com>`), never a work email.
- No new Python dependency without asking (no scipy: numpy and what is installed).
- The review server binds 127.0.0.1 only. `outputs/` (gitignored) holds names of real people
  (`player_names.json`, `roster.json`): never commit it.
- Benchmark-driven: change a step, run its benchmark, report the numbers before and after.

## Conventions

- Format web files with `npx prettier --single-quote --print-width 200` (no config file: the
  defaults restyle everything). Some files already differ; only format the ones you touch.
- The page's build is committed in `src/volleyball_stats/site/`: after any `web/` change run
  `npm run build` in `web/` and commit the build with it. It makes two scripts: the page, and
  `scene3d.js` (three.js) that the page loads only when the 3D view is shown.
- Python style: short docstrings, comments only where needed, `ponytail:` comments for deliberate
  limits with their upgrade path. Tests in `tests/`, web tests beside their helpers.

## Check a change

```bash
uv run pytest -q
cd web && npx tsc --noEmit -p . && npm test && npm run build
uv run python -m volleyball_stats.web outputs/side_setend --video data/side_setend.mp4 --court outputs/court/side_holdout.json
```

The page holds no video by default; `--footage full --club 1 --pictures` (saved in
`outputs/VIDEO/page.json`) brings back the video and the club's pictures for features that need them.

Then open `outputs/side_setend/site/index.html` (two sets) or `outputs/side_holdout/site/` (one
set). In browser checks mute the videos and check a phone width (no horizontal page scroll). The
"Analyse" columns stay empty on these short clips: lower `MIN_TRIES` in
`web/src/components/Stats/helpers/insights.ts` temporarily to see them, and restore it before the
build you commit. `benchmarks/scale.py` measures memory on a 2-hour match, `benchmarks/speed.py`
the trackers' speed (`outputs/speed/side_holdout_4k.mp4` is a 4K test copy).

## State and next steps

- Weak spots: `rallies.py` misses about a third of the rallies on the held-out clip, how a rally
  ends (in, out, fault) is the least reliable measure, attribution is right 71-83% of the time,
  identity IDF1 0.80-0.89. Free balls rest on one labelled example.
- Next: the owner films a first match (with consent); measure `speed.py` on the RTX 5080; tune
  rallies, contacts and jersey numbers on that 4K footage; hosting on OVH behind a password.
